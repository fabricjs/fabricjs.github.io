import { TextOnPath } from './TextOnPath';

This is an unfinished feature in FabricJS
You can specify a fabric.Path property for the text, called path, that will make the text render curved, following the path.
The feature is new, and has a lot of edge cases to be solved and improved.

In this demo we are using free drawing to draw a path, and then we inspect the path and try to calculate the best font size to fit the text to the path.

We are using the event `before:path:created` to access the path before it gets added to the canvas, calculate an approximate fontSize that will work on that path length, then add the text to the canvas.

Then are using `path:created` to remove the path from the canvas.

### On the canvas below use your mouse to draw something

<canvas id="canvas" width="500" height="400" ></canvas>
<TextOnPath client:idle />
