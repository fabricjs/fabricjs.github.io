import { EventInspectorUI } from './EventInspectorUI';
import '../../../css/demo-common.css';

This demo is a quick reference of the events you can get out of the objects or the canvas.
For a better understanding of events refer to this document: [Events](/docs/events).

This UI will let you understand which kind of events are available when working with Fabric.js.

There are 3 checkboxes to filter the events logging since events tied to mouse movements tend to be very noisy.
Each Log will have a 'plus' icon that will let you expand the data that comes with the event.
The log is capped at 100 events to avoid the UI to become unresponsive.
