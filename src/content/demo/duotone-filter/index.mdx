### Use the Composed filter to create a duotone effect

Fabric has a `Composed` filter that can be used to mix together different effects into a single one.
This is not much different than adding more than one filter in the `.filters` property of an image, but it comes handy when you want to define those 3 effects as a single block of effects with a meaning.

### The duotone effect

The duotone effect is obtained by reducing an image to two main tones that contrast with each other. This is similar to a black and white image, but mixing color A and color B rather than black to white.

Some tutorials such as this [one](https://codeburst.io/build-spotifys-colorizer-effect-with-javascript-35cb75fc638c) demonstrate how to create this effect with the standard canvas api.

The logic is as follow:
1. take a picture
2. make it black and white
3. blend a light color with multiply mode
4. blend a dark color with lighten mode

What follows is a simple FabricJS implementation of this technique.
Above the canvas we place two color pickers in order to change the input values to obtain different outputs.

<input type="color" id="colorLight" value="#00ff36" />
<input type="color" id="colorDark" value="#23278a" />
<canvas id="canvas" width="500" height="620" ></canvas>
<InputEventAttacher client:idle />
