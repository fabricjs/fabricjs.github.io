## Installation

FabricJS can be made available via following approaches as suited by your project

### Using from CDN via script tag

Include a script tag within your HTML page, from any cdn that offers this service like [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/fabric.js), [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/fabric), [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/)


```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fabric@latest/dist/index.min.js"></script>
```

### Installing from npm

```shell
npm i --save fabric
```

## Browser support

Following is a table portraying which browsers are supported.
In general you can always re-transpile to support older browsers, but some canvas features can't be transpiled or polyfilled.
