An even more expressive way to work with colors is via gradients. Gradients allow us to blend one color into another, creating some stunning graphical effects.

Fabric supports gradients via the `Gradient` class.

```
var circle = new fabric.Circle({
  left: 100,
  top: 100,
  radius: 50,
  fill = new fabric.Gradient({
    coords: {
      x1: 0,
      y1: 0,
      x2: 0,
      y2: circle.height,
    },
    colorStops: {
        0: '#000',
        1: '#fff'
    }
  }),
});
```

In the above example, we create a circle at 100,100 location, with 50px radius. We then set its fill to a gradient that spans throughout entire height of that circle, from black to white.

The argument passed to a method is an options object, which expects 2 coordinate pairs (x1, y1 and x2, y2), as well as "colorStops" object. Coordinates specify where gradient starts and where it ends. colorStops specify which colors a gradient is made of. You can define as many color stops as you want, as long as they range from 0 to 1 (e.g. 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, 1). 0 represents beginning of a gradient, 1 â€” its end.

Coordinates are relative to object top left corner, so the highest point of the circle is `0`, and the lowest point is `circle.height`. `setGradient` calculates width coordinates (x1, x2) in the same way.

Here's an example of left-to-right red-blue gradient:

```js
circle.fill = new Gradient({
  coords: {
    x1: 0,
    y1: 0,
    x2: circle.width,
    y2: 0,
  },
  colorStops: {
    0: "red",
    1: "blue"
  }
});
```

And here's a 5-stops rainbow gradient, with colors spanning at even 20% intervals:
```js
circle.fill = new Gradient({
  coords: {
    x1: 0,
    y1: 0,
    x2: circle.width,
    y2: 0,
  },
  colorStops: {
    0: "red",
    0.2: "orange",
    0.4: "yellow",
    0.6: "green",
    0.8: "blue",
    1: "purple"
  }
});
```
