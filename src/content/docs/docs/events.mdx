## Why events

Fabric.js offers hard coded interactions that are triggered by user interactions with the canvas.
During those actions the developer may want to react or run extra code, or even just update the state of the application.

Simple examples are:
- When an object has been selected
- When an object is being hovered
- When a transformation is finished

Events have been always part of fabric.js, way before the custom controls api and selection callbacks were introduced.
As a result events have also been used to modify standard fabric.js behaviours creating complex code flows.

## How events work

Both the BaseFabricObject class and the StaticCanvas inherit from an Observable class.
This class expose 4 methods, `on`, `off`, `once` and `fire`.

The  `on`, `off`, `once` are used to register and unregister event listeners:

```ts
const handler = function() {
  console.log('circle has been clicked');
}
// to register an event listener
const disposer = myCircle.on('mousedown', handler);

// to unregister an event listener call off
myCircle.off('mousedown', handler);
// or use the return value of on
dispose();
```

The disposer is a function that when called will remove the event listener, this may be easier
to use than keeping a reference to the handler function used with `on` as an alternative.

The handlers are called bound on the instance, so in the handler funcion the `this` is  either the fabric object or the fabric canvas.
Fat arrow functions can't be bound to anyhting else than the context in which they were created, so if you don't want unexpected side effects *use functions for event handers*
