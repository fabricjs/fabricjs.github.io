FabricJS offers a series of functions and classes to build your own controls for the objects and custom functionalities.

The fabric Canvas code is built to look into any object `controls` property for a map of controls to render target and use.

A default object, a Rect, has a map of Control classes that looks like this:

```ts

myRect.controls = {
  tl: Control{},
  tr: Control{},
  bl: Control{},
  br: Control{},
  ml: Control{},
  mr: Control{},
  mt: Control{},
  mb: Control{},
  mtr: Control{},
}

```

Each Control instance has as a minimum:

- a function to determine the position to render
- a function to render the control
- a function to run effects when the control is used
