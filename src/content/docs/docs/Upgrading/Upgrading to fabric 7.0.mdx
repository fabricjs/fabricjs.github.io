---

Fabric 7.0 is basically Fabric 6.0 there is no major change that should stop you from updating.

The reason for the major version change was the will to move to canvas version 3 and higher,
that itself required jsdom 26 and that required at least node 18.

In the process node 18 was remove too, since its support halted in April 2025 and while FabricJS can
still run ok on node 18, vitest 4 does not nor do the latest versions of jsdom.

Updating node on your project should be fairly easy, and is way more important than updating FabricJS.

Since a major version bump was happening also the list of supported browsers was refreshed to allow for better transpiling.
The current supported platform list looks like this

- NodeJS >= 20
- chrome >= 88
- safari >= 13
- firefox >= 85
- edge >= 88
- Opera >= 73

These browsers have been picked up with a random date of release of Jan 2021,
so browsers that at the moment of release are nearly 5 years old.

On top of supported platform changes, there are some notable api changes:

## Removing Opacity from Gradient ColorStop

FabricJS Gradient class supported ColorStop(s) that had a generic color and an opacity value,
mirroring SVG properties. Now this required that each render we would look at both the color value
for the color-stop and its opacity value and we would mix the 2, parsing a color value each render.

We decided to drop support for the opacity value and left the only opacity at the color value.
This will still allow you to have semi transparent gradients, but the way you specify or animate the
transparency is different.

The ColorStop type changes are:

```diff
export type ColorStop = {
  color: string;
  offset: number;
-  opacity?: number;
};
```
The color string supported an alpha value before and still does it, the double opacity is gone,
together with its confusion and performance hit.

If your application was doing heavy usage of the opacity property and was saving user data, there
is an update you can use to keep the old data working.
You can find it in
```ts
import { installGradientUpdater } from 'fabric/extensions';

installGradientUpdater();
```
It will wrap the fromObject function of Gradient to take care of the difference.
It is still suggested to clean up your old data when possible.

## Removed deprecations

### Events
The data duplication between `pointer`/`absolutePointer` and `viewportPoint`/`scenePoint` has been removed.
Now you find only viewportPoint and scenePoint in the events

### Canvas
- `getCenter` method has been removed, use only `getCenterPoint`
- The internal cache variables `_pointer` and `_absolutePointer` have been renamed to `_viewportPoint` and `_scenePoint` for clarity
- `preserveObjectStacking` is now default to `true`, if you want objects to break the stack when selected, set it to `false`
- `getPointer` deprecated method has been removed, is now a protected `_getPointerImpl` method.
- `setWidth` and `setHeight` are gone, use only `setDimensions({ width, height })`


### Objects
#### Text
- unused method `_getSVGLineTopOffset` has been deleted
#### Itext
- protected `_exitEditing` is merged with `exitEditingImpl` public
#### Image
- `CSS_CANVAS` static property from image is gone also with the `classList.Add` requirement

### Utils
- `rotatePoint` is gone, use `point.rotate` instead
- `request` is gone. We use fetch, node 18 supports fetch. There is no reason to use the old request object and status
- `setStyle` is gone
- `parseAttributes`, `parseStyleAttribute`, `parseFontDeclaration`, `parsePointsAttribute`, `parseTransformAttribute` and `getCSSRules`
have been removed from the package. Those utils were meant for internal usage and never for exposing this part of the api.
