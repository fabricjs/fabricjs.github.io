## Configuring default controls for objects

If you are looking for configuring default controls please check this other page [Configuring controls](/docs/configuring-controls/).
Every object in FabricJS ( rect, path, circle...) come with a serie of state properties that determine how the object looks like and some of the default interactive behaviours.

You can configure those value when instantiating the object or you may want to set certain properties at project level and forget about them.
There are a couple of common reasons why you would like to do that globally:
- you decide you don't want use caching
- you don't like the transparent 1px stroke around objects
- you want all your text objects to start with a custom font
- you may want to setup the project to work with originX and originY set on 'center' as suggested
