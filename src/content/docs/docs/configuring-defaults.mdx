## Configuring default controls for objects

If you are looking for configuring default controls please check this other page [Configuring controls](/docs/configuring-controls/).
Every object in FabricJS ( rect, path, circle...) come with a serie of state properties that determine how the object looks like and some of the default interactive behaviours.

You can configure those value when instantiating the object or you may want to set certain properties at project level and forget about them.
There are a couple of common reasons why you would like to do that globally:
- you decide you don't want use caching
- you don't like the transparent 1px stroke around objects
- you want all your text objects to start with a custom font
- you may want to setup the project to work with originX and originY set on 'center' as suggested

Most of the defaults are stored in a static property called <strong>ownDefaults</strong>.
When the instance is constructed this bag of properties is assigned to the instance with an Object.assign

if you want to change the default Font for the FabricText class for example you can do so by doing

```ts
import { FabricText } from 'fabric';

FabricText.ownDefaults.fontFamily = 'Lobster';
```

This will make every FabricText and every subclasses that inherits from it have the default font family as `Lobster` unless you specify differently in the constructor.

```ts
new FabricText('Hello World!') // Will have Lobster font

new FabricText('Hello World!', { fontFamily: 'Arial' }) // Will have Arial font
```

Take care you need to discover where FontFamily is defined before changing it.
Changing FontFamily on FabricObject will have no effect because FabricText has its own default, while setting it on IText or Textbox will leave FabricText with the original default.

As a thumb rule you should change your own defaults once as a way to configure FabricJS to adapt to your application needs.
Configuring defaults instead of setting every option on every object instance is something that will reduce clutter in your code, but is not going to be faster or better from a performance point of view.

There is a method called `getDefaults()` on the instances.
This will return an object that shows you which are the defaults for that instance.

This method is used on the `toObject` export to optionally avoid to export the default values to reduce the size of the output.

## A note on Prototype

Differently from FabricJS version 5 and earlier, this won't affect already constructed instances.

Javascript Classes syntax does not support properties on the Prototype that FabricJS was leveraging with Objects before.

If you really like the old behaviour you can still switch to it by writing some code.

Here is an example for FabricObject:

```ts
import { FabricObject } from 'fabric';

Object.assign(FabricObject.prototype, FabricObject.ownDefaults);
FabricObject.ownDefaults = {};
```

Note that you really need some strong reason to do so.
There are good points, like for example properties that are objects or arrays are not going to be duplicated per instance but shared across all of them.
On the other side this will create unexpected mutation side effects that you may not want in your application.
The default for fabricJS is on the safer side, with an eye to overridability.
