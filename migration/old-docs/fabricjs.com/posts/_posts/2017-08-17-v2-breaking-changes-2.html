  <h3>Selection handling</h3>
  <p>
    With the `Canvas` class fabric.js can handle a layer of selection / interaction.<br />
    Fabric can handle also multiple selection using a special class called `ActiveSelection`.<br />
    When a mouse interaction is performed by a user that utilize an app based on fabricJS, there are
    some built in selection functionalities.<br />
    What follow is a default overview of the selection process:<br />
     - Left click on an object selects it.<br />
     - Click and drag on the canvas creates a rectangular selection. All the bounding boxes intersecting with
     this rectangle will be selected on mouse up creating a multi selection.<br />
     - Clicking on objects with shift selects it or add it to the current selection, changing from a selected
     object to a multi selection of 2 objects.<br />
  </p>
  <h4>How this is handled internally</h4>
  <p>
    An object is selected and behaves as selected when is on a canvas and is referenced on that canvas <code>_activeObject</code>
    property.<br />
    A multi selection is represented by an <code>ActiveSelection</code> object, that is a special class derived from the <code>Group</code>
    class, referenced in the <code>_activeObject</code> property of the canvas.<br />
    There is one active object at time and it is either an object or a multi selection.
  </p>
  <h4>Modify the selection programatically</h4>
  <p>
    Developers can create/destroy or change selection, outside of user mouse interactions in the following ways:<br />
    <code>canvas.setActiveObject(object)</code> sets the object passed as argument as the active one. The current selected
    object gets discarded.<br />
    <code>canvas.discardActiveObject()</code> Remove the current selection.<br />
    <code>canvas.getActiveObject()</code> Returns a reference to the current active object.<br />
    <code>canvas.getActiveObjects()</code> Returns an array containing a reference to the current selected objects, one or many.<br />
    None of this methods render the canvas again, so you have to call <code>canvas.requestRenderAll</code> after them to see the changes.
    <code>canvas._setActiveObject()</code> and <code>canvas._discardActiveObject()</code> are two private method used from the non private ones
    to make the selection job. They do not contain the event firing code, and they are not chainable. if you need to handle a selection process
    but you do not want to fire the side effects you inserted in the selection events, you may try to use those.
  </p>
  <h4>Create a multi selection</h4>
<pre>// rect1 and rect2 are 2 object on a canvas, canvas is the canvas instance
var selection = new fabric.ActiveSelection([rect1, rect2], {
  canvas: canvas
});
canvas.setActiveObject(selection);</pre>
<h4>Add an object to a multi selection</h4>
<pre>// rect1 and rect2 are 2 object on a canvas, grouped in a multi selection
// rect3 is another object on the canvas
var selection = canvas.getActiveObject();
if (selection.type === 'activeSelection') {
  selection.addWithUpdate(rect3)
}</pre>
<p>So an object that is on a canvas can be an activeObject. Many object in a canvas can be grouped in an
  ActiveSelection object and behave like a multi seleciton. The objects inside the multi selection are still
  direct children of the canvas, and the ActiveSelection object, even if referenced in the `_activeObject` property
  of the canvas, <strong>it is not included in the canvas objects</strong>. canvas.getObjects() will not contain
  the ActiveSelection object. The active selection has a mandatory canvas property that has to be the actual canvas
  or it will not work.<br/>Future non breaking updates to fabric may simplify this aspect, changing the canvas property
  of the multi selection implictly in some method.<br />
  A take away point is that the ActiveSelection is a service class that behaves in some predetermined way and that has little
  space for customization.
</p>
<h4>IMPORTANT</h4>
<p>
  discardActiveObject on a multi selection triggers lot of side effects.
  If you are planning to do something with objects inside an active selection and reuse them, and then trash the activeSelection,
  <strong>first discardActiveObject</strong>, then do what you want to do with the objects, then in case select a new object.<br />
</p>
<h4>Removed methods</h4>
<p>
  The following methods are no more available since the introduction of ActiveSelection:<br />
</p>
<pre>setActiveGroup(group)
getActiveGroup();
deactivateAll();
discardActiveGroup();
deactivateAllWithDispatch();</pre>
<h3>How to react to user selection</h3>
<p>Regarding selections fabric provides callbacks and events.<br />
Events fired by objects are:
<pre>selected
deselected</pre>
Events fired by canvas are:
<pre>selection:created
selection:updated
before:selection:cleared
selection:cleared
// deprecated
object:selected
</pre>
For each object are available 2 callbacks
<pre>onDeselect
onSelect</pre>
Those callbacks are empty and meant to be overridden, and should not used to execute much logic,
but just to return a boolean to cancel the current process depending on dynamic conditions for
which mutating the properties of objects like selectable, evented or others, is not comfortable or
anyway brings to weird code paths.
</p>
<h4>Firing events</h4>
<p>Those events are meant to intercept user interaction with the selection of fabric.<br/>
You should expect the canvas to fire <code>selection:created</code> every time the user pass from a situation
of no selection to something selected. Each object involved in the seleciton process, one or more, by click or <body>
click and drag, will fire the <code>selected</code> event.<br />
When <code>selection:created</code> fires, it receives as first argument of the callback an object that contains <thead>
property 'selected', with an array of all the selected fabric instances.<br />
When an user remove or add an object from the multiselection or switch from single to multi selection, or simply move the selection
from the object A to the object B, the event <code>selection:updated</code> fires. The event receives as first argument of the
callback an object that contains both 'selected' and 'deselected'
property contaning an array of the objects that entered or exited the selection status. Each object involved in the process fires its
own single event.<br />
Finally when an user destroy a multiple selection or deselect an object, the event <code>selection:cleared</code> fires, getting in <thead>
arguments an object with the 'deselected' property. <br />
The event <code>object:selected</code> is considered deprecated and will be removed in the next major version of fabricjs.
<h4>Callbacks on multiple selection</h4>
The callbacks onSelect and onDeselect are not available yet on the click and drag selection or on the shift click selection and will
be added as a feature as soon as branch 2.0 is ready.
